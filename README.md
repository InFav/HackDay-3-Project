# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

First run the server by running node server.js
Then run npm run dev to run the vite project.

Persona = Job Title; like startup founder etc
JSON.stringify(analyticsJson) = Analytics/Conversation type of the LinkedIn posts that the user has submitted
postPurpose = The purpose of the post that we want gemini to create.
personalStory = What are some things personal that the user want Gemini to use to create the post.
